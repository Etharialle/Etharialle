# Website Notes

## Mkdocs

Using Python library Mkdocs to create website from markdown files

### Steps for building the site

I'm using Mkdocs installed via pip.  First thing is to check if mkdocs is installed using `mkdocs --version`. If it needs to be installed it can be done so with `pip install mkdocs`.  If necessary add the following path to `.bashrc`"

`export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`
