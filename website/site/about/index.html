<p>I'm a Systems Engineer and Project Manager looking to make career shift to software engineering.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-bring-to-the-table">What I bring to the table</h2>
<ul>
<li>15 years of experience in systems engineering and project management</li>
<li>Coding proficency in Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</li>
<li>Understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</li>
<li>Development and testing in both Waterfall and Agile environments</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-the-switch">Why the switch</h2>
<p>During my time as a Systems Engineer some of things I have been most passionate about is finding ways to automate some of the work I do and make my process more efficient.</p>
<p>A prime example of this was writing scripts in Python to access REST APIs to extract test data, transform that data using libraries like Pandas and then analyze the results of test data to determine if the implementation met the requirements (i.e. was the test successful), if it wasn't what issues needed to be fixed.</p>
<p>I've worked all along the "V" of Systems Engineering (see below for a brief overview of systems engineering). What I have not had the opportunity to do is the implentation of all the work I have done in systems enginering.</p>

<summary><strong>A little background on the systems engineering process</strong></summary>

Systems Engineering is typically thought of as a "V-Model" where a project is started on the left beginning with a problem to be solved. Systems engineers will break that problem down using concepts of operations (CONOPS), functional architectures, and requirements derivation. As the problem is broken down into smaller and smaller chunks this though of as working down the left side of the "V" until there is a set of requirements that development teams can use for design the implementation. Going up the right side of the "V" the system is _verified_ against the requirements at different levels (unit tests, component tests, assembly tests, etc.) until the system is tested as whole to ensure it meets the needs of the original project, i.e. _validation_.

<h2 id="what-i-have-done-to-prepare-for-career-change">What I have done to prepare for career change</h2>
<p>As mentioned above I have used Python in my roles as a systems engineer. My professional experience has also included writing SQL, VBA scripts, reading code in TypeScript, C++, Python, and YAML.</p>
<p>The repositories on this account include the projects I have made while expanding my programming and system design skills.</p>
<p>I have used the following languages and tools to build my projects:</p>
<h3 id="highlighted-projects">Highlighted Projects</h3>
<h4 id="animal-shelter-data-analysis-project">Animal Shelter Data Analysis Project</h4>
<p>This project is completely free-form project I built from the ground up to so I could analyze the data from local animal shelters. Define some prescriptive analytics and showcase the result.</p>
