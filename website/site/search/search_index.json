What I bring to the table 15 years of experience in systems engineering and project management Coding proficency in Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS Understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Development and testing in both Waterfall and Agile environments Why the switch During my time as a Systems Engineer some of things I have been most passionate about is finding ways to automate some of the work I do and make my process more efficient. A prime example of this was writing scripts in Python to access REST APIs to extract test data, transform that data using libraries like Pandas and then analyze the results of test data to determine if the implementation met the requirements (i.e. was the test successful), if it wasn't what issues needed to be fixed. I've worked all along the \"V\" of Systems Engineering (see below for a brief overview of systems engineering). What I have not had the opportunity to do is the implentation of all the work I have done in systems enginering. A little background on the systems engineering process Systems Engineering is typically thought of as a \"V-Model\" where a project is started on the left beginning with a problem to be solved. Systems engineers will break that problem down using concepts of operations (CONOPS), functional architectures, and requirements derivation. As the problem is broken down into smaller and smaller chunks this though of as working down the left side of the \"V\" until there is a set of requirements that development teams can use for design the implementation. Going up the right side of the \"V\" the system is _verified_ against the requirements at different levels (unit tests, component tests, assembly tests, etc.) until the system is tested as whole to ensure it meets the needs of the original project, i.e. _validation_. What I have done to prepare for career change As mentioned above I have used Python in my roles as a systems engineer. My professional experience has also included writing SQL, VBA scripts, reading code in TypeScript, C++, Python, and YAML. The repositories on this account include the projects I have made while expanding my programming and system design skills. I have used the following languages and tools to build my projects: Highlighted Projects Animal Shelter Data Analysis Project This project is completely free-form project I built from the ground up to so I could analyze the data from local animal shelters. Define some prescriptive analytics and showcase the result. Repo Link Live Site Skills Used: Todo App A JavaScript project built while learning from The Odin Project .

Steps For Setting Up The Build 1) Create WORKSPACE file in root directory 2) Create MODULE.bazel file in root directory 3) create BUILD file in root directory 4) Create .bazelrc file in root directory Bazel Commands Build Commands Running bazel build serenity tells bazel to compile the binary named \"serenity\" in the BUILD file. If the BUILD file is not in the root directory of the project then //<path to BUILD>:name would used such as bazel build //src:serenity if the BUILD file was in the src directory and the name in the cc_binary rule was still \"serenity\" by default the binary is stored in project-root/bazel-bin/ so from the root directory the following would be used to run the binary: ./bazel-bin/serenity CMake I previosuly tried CMake and it's quite a headache for me.
